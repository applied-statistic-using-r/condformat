## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the vignette builder to prevent message 
  'Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index'.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 14.04 install, R 3.3.1
* ubuntu 12.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs nor NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
There are no known downstream dependencies.
