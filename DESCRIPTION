Description: Apply and visualize conditional formatting to data frames
    in R. It presents a data frame as an HTML table with cells CSS formatted
    according to criteria defined by rules. It uses the dplyr and magrittr
    to provide an easy to use syntax, and htmlTable to render the data.frame
    in HTML. The table is printed either opening a web browser or within the
    RStudio viewer if available.
    The conditional formatting rules allow to highlight cells matching a condition
    or add a gradient background to a given column based on a column values.
